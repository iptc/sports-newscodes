## IPTC Newscodes ...

IPTC provides a rich set of vocabularies for the exchange of news and news related data: https://iptc.org/standards/newscodes/

## ... for sports data

A subset of about 110 Newscodes vocabularies is dedicated to the use with sports data, in particular with IPTC's sport data XML format SportsML 3 - https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/ 

All these vocabularies are provided in two ways
* as IPTC Knowledge Item files in this repository
* as online resources on the IPTC CV server - see http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/#sportcvs . The CV server makes the vocabularies visible to humans by HTML pages and makes available downloads as IPTC Knowledge Items or as schemes in RDF/XML or RDF/Turtle.

Note: an IPTC Knowledge Item is the XML format for schemes of concepts in the family of NewsML-G2 items. The format of Knowledge Items is described in detail at http://dev.iptc.org/NewsCodes-G2-Knowledge-Items-by-IPTC
